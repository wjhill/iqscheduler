iqschedule: Intelligent Scheduler

(or, what I literally did for my Summer Vacation a decade ago)

Back when I was younger, I spent a few months organizing ~950 classes for an annual event I used to attend (it's happening now, as I write the inital version of this README, in fact.)

For various reasons, the software used to organize the event was...behind, so I took it upon myself to write a tool to not just track all those classes, but also to help me schedule them. I had no interest in sorting out, by hand, all the scheduling permutations that cann occur with multiple locations, people, and events you have to account for.

What's shocking is that, a decade later, I'm finding the state-of-the-art isn't much better. I mean, we have much better UI/UX for scheduling, but the backend is still really, really dumb. You the user are still by and large forced to figure all this stuff out, yourself.

This is me re-applying the automation in the modern age. We'll see how far it goes. :)
